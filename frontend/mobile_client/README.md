globalContext branch is adding react context API to the app, allowing for global context within the app,
this is being used instead of redux/react-redux for global state

some basic navigation templates have been put into the app as well and should be easy enough to work with

may need to npm install --save react-native-gesture-handler if react-navigation requires it, if so then run
react-native link react-native-gesture-handler to link the dependencies properly
